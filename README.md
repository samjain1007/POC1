Vrbo Map part using HTML,CSS,Javascript 

Only the Highlights and Outdoor Activities buttons are functional. Data used is in the form of array of objects.Addeventlistener is used for adding events . 
And an array is used to keep a track of indices , so that same indices don't have to be reloaded again. 
Here , I have assumed that at most 6 items will be displayed in location section.
